# TEALS

This is my repo for **Introduction to Software Technologies**!

## Second Level Header

Three things that we will talk about here are:
1. The parts of git
2. Markdown for READMEs and wikis
3. Styling with themes using HTML and CSS

### Third Level Header

Some languages that we can discuss for programming
- C/C++
- Fortran
- *Python*
- Julia

#### Level 4
This is for a class at [Towers HS](https://www.towershs.dekalb.k12.ga.us/).
And we can insert images too! ![Towers HS logo](https://www.towershs.dekalb.k12.ga.us/sysimages/logo.png)
##### Level 5
We can add code blocks to our page based on language

```python
import numpy as np

for i in np.arange(10):
    print(i)
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo hello
```

###### Level 6

Adding tables is also pretty "easy"
|Column 1|Column 2|
|--------|--------|
|Row 1|Value 1|
|Row 2|Value 2|
|Row 3|Value 3|
